        <h2>Getting started in web development</h2>
        <p>
            This webpage marks the beginning of my adventure in coding. It's a simple start, but every developer has to take the first step 
            creating bigger and better things.
        </p>

        <h3> What I'm Building</h3>
        <p>
            Here you'll find the first examples of my work as I explore HTML and wed design. I'm learning how to structure content, style it,
             and eventually make it interactive. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My focus right now is on understanding the basics. Each project helps me improve my skills and boosts my confidence as a future
             software developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm excited about the journey ahead abd cant wait to share more projects as I continue to grow in thus field. Stay tuned for more
             updates!
